# FinalFridayChallenge

# What Was the Challenge?
The challenge was the write an Ansible playbook that would install docker on my local machine. The stretch goal was then to use Ansible to create roles that would add NGINX into a Docker container.

# How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected the challenge to encompass a lot of content as it was our last challenge, so my expectation was that it was going to be difficult to complete.

# What went well?
Everything. Ben always championed the idea of being able to google elements of your work when we're stuck, and the different commands and prompts on ansible were definitely a lot to remember, so I had to google lots of information, but I managed to compose the playbook that worked correctly. Even though I got some of the answers from googling, I still had to work through my own errors, of which there were plenty, but managed to work through syntax, sudo permissions etc. without assistance. Furthermore, I also revisited the videos from the week, and after a prompt from Ben I also believe I managed to get the stretch goal to successfully work, which I felt very proud about, as I managed to get a working product at the end for both tasks, which is something I was yet to achieve on previous challenges during my time so far in the academy.

# What didn't go as planned?
My plan was to just get stuck into the work, and by the nature of these kind of tasks just work my way through them. So the execution didn't deviate too far from the plan this week, thankfully.

# Possible Improvements for future challenges:
As above, I am really happy with how this week's challenge went, successfully completing both tasks was a real achievement. However, naturally I think there is always room for improvement. My base knowledge on ansible commands and their functionally could do with being a locally stored in my brain some more, instead of pulling down knowledge from the internet all the time I need to write them (puns were absolutely intended). Further to this, I also need to just swat up on the port numbers that specific applications run on, as I think it's handy knowledge to have, as I couldn't remember the port my NGINX container had to run on. Finally, albeit somewhat unrelated to the challenge, would be to increase my working knowledge of how Jenkins and other plugins/applications interact, as Jenkins is such as hugely diverse tool, its difficult to remember how everything pieces together.
